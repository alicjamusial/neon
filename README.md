### about the project

<img align="left" width="100" height="100" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alicjamusial/neon/master/NEON.png?token=ADRBKKWMFAFR7CQ3XAW7DLK7OYRAK"> Neon is a PCB project designed as an adapter for FTDI FT4232H Mini Module board. It includes four marked sockets (A, B, C, D) with logic analyser output for all FTDI's UARTs and LEDs on both TX/RX and USB power supply.


Version 1.0 is available [in the releases section](https://github.com/alicjamusial/neon/releases/tag/neon-v.1.0).

### usage
To be able to use Neon powered by USB two jumpers needs to be placed on the board (on J1 (3V3 & VIO) and J5 (VCC & VBUS) elements).

### license
Neon is available on Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike 4.0 International license (more in [license file](LICENSE.txt)). You are free to use it, modify it and produce as many of your own neons as you need :)
